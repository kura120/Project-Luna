old script (cheat) for Roblox, executors went berserk because of byfron anticheat so i'm just releasing the source code of my scripthub 

- ~100k views in [ScriptBlox](https://scriptblox.com) (a widely known roblox script finder)
- had a discord with ~5k members, unfortunately i deleted it though

1. Project Slayers
2. Da Hood
3. Raise a Peter
4. Tapping Legends X
5. Pet Simulator X
6. Michael's Zombies
7. No-Scope Arcade
8. Arsenal
9. Counter Blox
10. ShadovisRPG
11. Pistol 1v1
